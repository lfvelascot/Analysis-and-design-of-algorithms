| Activities | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Marathon exercises log |Contains all the exercises done related to programming marathons, exercises done in java or python with flow diagrams and pseudo code |
| Python log |Log of the python course module 1, where all the basic python concepts, python structures, object-oriented programming and graphical interface are explained. |
| Workshop 2 | Workshop where all types of algorithms and examples of use of each one are shown.|
| Sorting algorithms in Python | Contains the recursive and / or iterative sorting algorithms developed in Python.|
| Coronavirus Project| Program for the management of the data related to the Covid-19 of each of the countries, in this program the number of infected and dead by country is managed, in addition to showing the total of each of the stored data, and the date updating the data. |
