| Python log |Log of the python course module 1, where all the basic python concepts, python structures, object-oriented programming and graphical interface are explained. Click on the following image to see the course that took place at pildorasinformaticas.es [![Python](https://www.redeszone.net/app/uploads/2018/07/C%C3%B3digo-Python.jpg)](https://www.pildorasinformaticas.es/course/curso-python/)|
| Algorithm classification | Workshop where all types of algorithms and examples of use of each one are shown. Here you can find the document that explains and gives examples of each of the types of algorithms, and the executables with the algorithms made in Java.
